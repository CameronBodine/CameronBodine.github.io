abstract: 'The characterization of benthic habitats is essential for aquatic ecosystem
  science and management, but is frequently limited by waterbody visibility and depth.
  Recreation‐grade side‐scan sonar systems are increasingly used to aid scientific
  inquiries in aquatic environments due to their relative low‐cost, ease of operation,
  low‐weight, and ease of mounting on a variety of vessels. However, existing procedures
  and software for post‐processing these data are either limited, closed source, or
  fail on data from new sonar models, limiting the development of reproducible workflows.
  Here, we present PING‐Mapper, an open‐source and freely available side‐scan sonar
  post‐processing toolset for processing and mapping sonar recordings from popular
  Humminbird instruments. The modular software automatically: (a) decodes sonar recordings
  from any Humminbird system, (b) exports ping attributes from every sonar channel,
  (c) uses sonar sensor depth for water column removal, and (d) exports sonogram tiles
  and georectified mosaics. Sonar channels are processed in parallel for quick decoding
  and metadata extraction. Major processing wokflows, including georectification and
  image export, are optimized to scale with computing resources. The software has
  been extensively tested using data from several rivers of varying character and
  distribution of depths, but could also be used in estuarine and lacustrine environments.
  Usage of PING‐Mapper is illustrated in three case studies focused on mapping large
  woody debris, bathymetric mapping, and visual interpretation and mapping of substrates
  for selected reaches of the Pearl and Pascagoula river systems in Mississippi.'
