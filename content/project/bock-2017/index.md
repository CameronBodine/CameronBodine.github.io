abstract: 'Side scan sonar for benthic habitat mapping is an efficient, low-cost approach for mapping habitat features in navigable rivers and streams. It provides a means to create high resolution, spatially detailed maps of continuous, instream habitat across broad aquatic landscapes. The sub-basins selected for this project include: Lower Choctawhatchee, Lower Ochlockonee, Withlacoochee, Peace, and Lower Suwannee. The habitat maps produced will provide valuable information that can be used to identify critical habitat for numerous species. The benthic habitat maps will provide the baseline data needed for instream habitat monitoring. These maps, depicting substrate and large woody debris, will provide a measure of location and amount of various habitat types for aquatic species. Temporal changes in the location and amount can be tracked and provide a means of habitat monitoring. These maps will also identify potential areas for restoration. Additionally, mapping pre- and post-restoration efforts can aid in monitoring the outcomes of those efforts.
Approximately 693 river kilometers (RKM) have been scanned across the five river basins including image rectification. All navigable sections of the Peace, Withlacoochee, Choctawhatchee Suwannee and the Ochlockonee Rivers have been completely mapped. Accuracy assessments have been completed for the Peace, Withlacoochee, Choctawhatchee Ochlockonee, and the Suwannee Rivers.'
